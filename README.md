* It's for kids and it took a year of effort to get this good at this language so if I used a more complex program this game would be worse 

ColorZilla
* to get colors 

MS paint 
* I made one of the sprites on it 

Discord 
* I used this to download music from Noah who made music for the game and talk with my friend Marcus who helped with the code 

## Purpose
